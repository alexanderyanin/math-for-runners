# Math for Runners

Started running in July 2021
- August 2 ran the first 5 km
- October 9 ran the first 10 km

In the process of learning to run, I collected a lot of information that helps to run safely, maintaining the health of the body and especially the heart.

I decided to translate all the knowledge into a program for a quick calculation and understanding of what your body is capable of at the moment.

## TODO
- add all necessary calculation tools
- release the web version of the application
- add information on general physical fitness
- add information on special running exercises
